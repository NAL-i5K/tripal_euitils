BioProject
==========

- **NCBI BioProject**: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject
- **Chado Project**: https://laceysanderson.github.io/chado-docs/tables/project.html

The Chado project table will provide many more linkers in Chado 1.4: until that discussion is resolved, this module will not take full advantage of NCBI BioProjects.
